This folder contains the NDBC annual update scripts that are run each year. Although these scripts mirror those in the original <scripts> folder, there are start_date adjustments throughout. These scripts are also formatted for local PC runs, due to the reduction in the data size of annual update runs. 
  
USE THESE SCRIPTS FOR ANNUAL UPDATES. Follow the main SOP for directions.
